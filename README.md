This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Dockerfiles: using shell commands directly within RUN instructions without the `exec` form.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as issues with environment variables and potential security vulnerabilities if the command accidentally executes unintended actions. The `Dockerfile_fixed` shows the corrected approach, using the `exec` form for enhanced security and control.
